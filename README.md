## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist in the early detection of heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management of these diseases. This project uses several machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of these diseases based on input features.

## Dataset

The datasets used for this project are sourced from Kaggle website. The data includes features such as age, blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, etc.

- Heart Disease Dataset
- Kidney Disease Dataset
- Diabetes Dataset

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository
   ```
   https://github.com/abdelkarim-alili/Prediction-of-Chronic-Diseases-by-Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2- Navigate to the project directory.  
3- Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).  
4- Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Models

The project includes the implementation of the following machine learning algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are compared to determine the best-performing model for each disease prediction.
